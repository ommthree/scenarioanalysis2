## Script for tidying up the directory

# The only things in the root directory should be tidyup.md (this file) and README.md - everything else must be tidied away
# Every directory and file should be listed in README.md. Add any which are not there
# Every md file should be listed in doc/docu/md.md. Add any which are not there.
# Every C++ and other code file should be listed in doc/docu/codefiles.md. Add any which are not there. For each subroutine and function we need to know where it is saved, where it is called, what it calls, what its arguments are, what it returns, whether it inherits or is inherited by anything. At the top of the file is an up-to-date visual layout of the project.
# Every table in the main database must be detailed in doc/target/schema.md
