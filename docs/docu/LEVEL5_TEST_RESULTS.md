# Level 5 Test Results: Additional Non-Cash Items

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Template:** TEST_UNIFIED_L5
**Test:** `test_level5.cpp`

## Overview

Level 5 extends Level 4 by introducing additional non-cash expense types that affect different balance sheet accounts. This demonstrates the flexibility of the unified engine to handle multiple non-cash items with distinct balance sheet impacts.

### Key Additions Over Level 4

1. **AMORTIZATION**: Non-cash expense that reduces Intangible Assets
2. **Additional validation rules**: Intangible Assets rollforward
3. **Driver mapping architecture**: Implemented base_value_source mapping (OPEX → OPERATING_EXPENSES)

**Note:** Stock-Based Compensation is included in the template but set to $0 in testing to avoid equity accounting complexity (would require APIC account).

## Test Configuration

### Drivers (3 periods)

| Period | REVENUE | COGS | OPEX | DEPRECIATION | AMORTIZATION | STOCK_COMP |
|--------|---------|------|------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| 1      | 100,000 | 0    | -10,000 | -5,000 | -3,000 | 0 |
| 2      | 110,000 | 0    | -11,000 | -5,000 | -3,000 | 0 |
| 3      | 120,000 | 0    | -12,000 | -5,000 | -3,000 | 0 |

**Note:** Driver codes (OPEX, COGS, STOCK_COMP) are mapped to line item codes (OPERATING_EXPENSES, COST_OF_GOODS_SOLD, STOCK_BASED_COMPENSATION) via `base_value_source` field.

### Opening Balance Sheet

```

  Cash:                 $1,000,000
  Accounts Receivable:      $10,000
  Inventory:                $20,000
  Fixed Assets:            $100,000
  Intangible Assets:        $50,000  (NEW in Level 5)
  ─────────────────────────────────
  Total Assets:          $1,180,000

```

**Key Formula:**
```
CF_OPERATING = NI - DEPRECIATION - AMORTIZATION - STOCK_COMP
               - DELTA_AR - DELTA_INV + DELTA_AP
             = 82,000 - (-5,000) - (-3,000) - 0 - 5,000 - 0 + 0
             = 82,000 + 5,000 + 3,000 - 5,000
             = 85,000 ✓
```

### Balance Sheet

```

## Validation Results

All **12 validation rules** passed for all 3 periods:

### Core Validations
1. ✅ **POSITIVE_REVENUE** - Revenue ≥ 0
2. ✅ **NET_INCOME_CALC_L5** - NI = GP + OPEX + DEPR + AMORT + STOCK_COMP
3. ✅ **RE_ROLLFORWARD** - RE = RE[t-1] + NET_INCOME
4. ✅ **CF_NET_CALCULATION** - CF_NET = CF_OPERATING + CF_INVESTING + CF_FINANCING
5. ✅ **CASH_ROLLFORWARD** - CASH = CASH[t-1] + CF_NET
6. ✅ **BS_EQUATION** - Assets = Liabilities + Equity

### Working Capital Validations
7. ✅ **CF_OPERATING_CALC_L5** - CF_OP = NI - DEPR - AMORT - STOCK - ΔAR - ΔINV + ΔAP
8. ✅ **AR_ROLLFORWARD** - AR = AR[t-1] + REVENUE - CASH_COLLECTIONS
9. ✅ **INVENTORY_ROLLFORWARD** - INV = INV[t-1] + PURCHASES + COGS
10. ✅ **AP_ROLLFORWARD** - AP = AP[t-1] + PURCHASES - CASH_PAYMENTS

### Long-Term Asset Validations
11. ✅ **FIXED_ASSETS_ROLLFORWARD** - FA = FA[t-1] + DEPRECIATION
12. ✅ **INTANGIBLE_ASSETS_ROLLFORWARD** - IA = IA[t-1] + AMORTIZATION

## Key Observations

### 1. Multiple Non-Cash Items Working Correctly

**Depreciation** (reduces Fixed Assets):
```
Period 1: $100,000 → $95,000  (-$5,000)
Period 2:  $95,000 → $90,000  (-$5,000)
Period 3:  $90,000 → $85,000  (-$5,000)
```

**Amortization** (reduces Intangible Assets):
```
Period 1: $50,000 → $47,000  (-$3,000)
Period 2: $47,000 → $44,000  (-$3,000)
Period 3: $44,000 → $41,000  (-$3,000)
```

Both are correctly:
- Deducted from Net Income (expenses)
- Added back in Operating Cash Flow (non-cash)
- Reducing their respective balance sheet accounts

### 2. Cash Flow Reconciliation

Each period, the cash increase equals the net cash flow:

| Period | Opening Cash | CF_Net | Ending Cash | Increase |
|--------|--------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | 1,000,000 | 85,000 | 1,085,000 | 85,000 ✓ |
| 2 | 1,085,000 | 93,500 | 1,178,500 | 93,500 ✓ |
| 3 | 1,178,500 | 102,000 | 1,280,500 | 102,000 ✓ |

### 3. Balance Sheet Always Balances

Every period passes the balance sheet equation validation:

| Period | Total Assets | Total Liab | Total Equity | Difference |
|--------|--------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Opening | 1,180,000 | 5,000 | 1,175,000 | 0.00 ✓ |
| 1 | 1,262,000 | 5,000 | 1,257,000 | 0.00 ✓ |
| 2 | 1,353,000 | 5,000 | 1,348,000 | 0.00 ✓ |
| 3 | 1,453,000 | 5,000 | 1,448,000 | 0.00 ✓ |

## Technical Achievement: Driver Mapping

### Problem Solved

Previously, UnifiedEngine required driver codes to exactly match line item codes. This broke the abstraction between:
- **Driver codes** (short, concise: "OPEX", "COGS", "STOCK_COMP")
- **Line item codes** (descriptive: "OPERATING_EXPENSES", "COST_OF_GOODS_SOLD", "STOCK_BASED_COMPENSATION")

### Solution Implemented

**DriverValueProvider now supports template-based mapping:**

1. Parses `base_value_source` field from template JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "code": "OPERATING_EXPENSES",
     "base_value_source": "driver:OPEX"
   }
   ```

2. Builds mapping: `OPERATING_EXPENSES → OPEX`

3. When asked for "OPERATING_EXPENSES", resolves to "OPEX" and looks up in scenario_drivers

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Short codes in database tables
- ✅ Descriptive names in financial statements
- ✅ Backward compatible (works when codes match)

### Impact on Other Tests

**Level 4 was also fixed** by this implementation:
- **Before:** NI = $95,000 (COGS and OPEX not loading)
- **After:** NI = $35,000 ✓ (correct: 100k - 50k - 10k - 5k)

## Conclusion

✅ **Level 5 Complete!**

- 32 line items successfully calculated across 3 periods
- All validation rules passing
- Multiple non-cash items working correctly (Depreciation + Amortization)
- Each non-cash item affects different balance sheet accounts
- Driver mapping architecture implemented and tested
- Balance sheet balances every period
- Cash flow reconciles to balance sheet changes

**What This Proves:**
1. UnifiedEngine can handle complex multi-statement models
2. Non-cash expenses are correctly:

   - Added back in Cash Flow
   - Reducing specific balance sheet accounts
3. Working capital mechanics integrate seamlessly with non-cash items
4. The mega-DAG automatically orders calculations correctly
5. Driver mapping provides clean abstraction layer

**Next Steps:**
- Level 6 could add: Interest expense, tax calculations, debt accounts
- Or: CapEx investing activities, fixed asset additions
- Or: Equity financing activities, dividends

**Files:**
- Template: `data/templates/test/level5_unified.json`
- Test: `engine/tests/test_level5.cpp`
