## Time Analysis

### Consumed vs Remaining

| Category | Milestones | Days | Weeks | Percentage |
|----------|------------|------|-------|------------|
| **Completed** | M1-M7 | 56 | 7.8 | 47% |
| **Remaining** | M8-M15 | 64 | 8.9 | 53% |
| **TOTAL Phase A** | M1-M15 | 120 | 16.7 | 100% |

---

### Schedule Analysis

**Original Plan:** 15 milestones √ó 8-10 days = 120-150 days = 6-7.5 months (1 developer)

**Actual Progress:**
- 7 milestones completed in ~4 weeks (Oct 1-12)
- **Pace:** ~5-6 days per milestone (faster than plan!)
- **Reason:** Unified architecture simplified M5-M7

**Adjusted Estimate:**
- 8 remaining milestones √ó 8 days = 64 days
- At current pace: **~9 weeks**
- **Target completion:** Mid-December 2025

---

### Risk Factors

#### Schedule Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| M11 (GUI) complexity | +2-4 days | Start with minimal UI, iterate |
| M13 (Dashboard) polish | +2-4 days | Basic charts first, animations later |
| M14 (Correlations) complexity | +2-4 days | Start with simple correlations |
| Integration issues (M10-M13) | +5-10 days | Weekly integration testing |
| Scope creep on M8 (Carbon) | +2-4 days | Follow plan strictly |

**Total Risk Buffer:** +13-26 days (2-4 weeks)

**Conservative Completion:** Mid-January 2026 (instead of Mid-December)

---

### Acceleration Opportunities

**If 2 developers working in parallel:**
- M8-M9 can run concurrently (backend)
- M10-M11 can run concurrently (API + GUI)
- M12-M13 can run concurrently (AI + Dashboard)
- M14-M15 can run sequentially (dependencies)

**Parallel Timeline:**
- Week 1-2: M8 + M9 (parallel) = 2 weeks
- Week 3-4: M10 + M11 (parallel) = 2 weeks
- Week 5-6: M12 + M13 (parallel) = 2 weeks
- Week 7-8: M14, M15 (sequential) = 2 weeks
- **Total:** ~8 weeks (vs 9 weeks sequential)

**Savings:** 1 week

### Medium-Term Strategy

1. **Prioritize M8-M10:** Core functionality before UI polish
2. **Defer M12 if needed:** AI features are nice-to-have
3. **Simple first, polish later:** M11/M13 start with minimal UI
4. **Weekly integration:** Don't wait until M15 to integrate components

### Resource Allocation

**If budget allows for 2 developers:**
- Developer A: Backend (M8, M9, M10, M14)
- Developer B: Frontend (M11, M13) + AI (M12)
- **Timeline reduction:** 9 weeks ‚Üí 7-8 weeks

**If 1 developer:**
- Follow sequential plan
- Focus on M8-M10 first (core functionality)
- M11-M13 can be iterative (add features over time)
