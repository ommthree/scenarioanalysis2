## Document Maintenance

### When to Update This File
- New markdown document added to `/docs`
- Document status changes (draft ‚Üí final, final ‚Üí superseded)
- Document renamed or moved
- Document deleted

### Naming Conventions
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for major documents (e.g., TARGET_STATE.md)
- Use Title_Case for specific documents (e.g., M1_Detailed_Workplan.md)
- Prefix with M# for milestone-specific documents
- Store all in `/docs` directory (flat structure for now)

### Version Control
- All documentation tracked in Git
- Tag milestones: `git tag v0.1.0-m1`
- Keep deprecated docs for historical reference
- Update "Last Updated" date when editing
